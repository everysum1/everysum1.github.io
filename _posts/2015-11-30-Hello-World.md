title: Hello World! My first blog post
---

//This is a line of code \n

Not really.  They're just comments.  This is my actual blog, written in the time that it was thought and typed across the
keyboard, as fast as I could type it...


On my first night, I feel good.  I feel like doing more.  Like doing extra.  That's why 
I started this blog.  If what they're telling us at Telegraph Academy is true however, I
feel like soon it won't be like that though.  Today was 
just review, tomorrow there will be a test.  I didn't really struggle with anything today
except on the writing out of JSON.stringify and getElementByClass, but I was purposely
trying to make it more difficult by writing it from scratch as opposed to looking at my
notes.  Still, I don't see myself studying much tonight.  Tomorrow will be a review and 
if today was any indication (which it most likely wasn't) of tomorrow and how much i've 
retained of underbar, recursion, and twittler, i'll be ok.  That and I need my sleep.  
That will be my biggest struggle of this whole schooling: getting up in the morning.  
Good to keep it in mind here and get one of my housemates to wake me up violently rather
than pretending its not a problem.  Once i'm there (and I have unlimited access to coffee)
I'm good.  

I really can't wait to get started on building web pages though.  That was the most 
appealing to me about the whole fulcrum curriculum: when we got to build a web page.  
Sure it was crude and I could have spent sooooo much more time on the CSS page, but 
man, it was really cool to see something like that work, how you could change it to 
make it better, get it just the way you want it, build buttons and text boxes and 
put pictures on it (or moving images!), i'm just getting excited thinking about it 
now actually ha ha, its just really freakin cool in a nerdy kind of way and I don't
care.  But we live on web pages nowadays.  I know people that camp out on twitter or 
facebook most of the day.  I know some sites feel like home.  I know people can't run 
their businesses without their web pages.  I know some companies who's only product is
their web page or app.  I am starting to see the power of how the skillset i'm building
is something this world needs, and how many people my work can reach.  MILLIONS!!! No, 
B...BILLIONS!!! This is going to be awesome.  

Well, I better get some sleep.  Nothing can replace sleep when you iz learnin.
